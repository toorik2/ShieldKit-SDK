# BN254 singleton libraries

Shared CashScript function files for the BN254 Groth16 verifier, consumed by the contracts in the
parent directory (`../*.cash`). These rely on the custom cashc fork's top-level (global) functions +
`import` support (branch `compiler-optimizations`): a library file is just a bag of plain top-level
`function`s (no `library` wrapper, no `internal` keyword, no `contract`), and `import "./X.cash";`
brings its functions into scope unqualified. Top-level `constant`s are supported by the fork (folded
to literals; still fork-only pending upstream #264); the field prime is otherwise written as a
literal at each use site and folded by the compiler.

## Why a `contract` per layer

The full verifier is `../groth16.cash`. The other parent-directory contracts (`fp2`, `fp6`, `fp12`,
`fp12_inv`, `fp12_frob`, `mul034`, `g2lines`, `miller`, `miller4`, `finalexp`, `verify`,
`vkx`) are **per-layer test harnesses**: each is a small `contract` whose `spend()` exercises
only that one layer's operations and is graded against the reference implementation (`@noble/curves`)
by its `.mjs`.

Keeping one gradable contract per layer buys:

- **Pinpointed failures** — verifying bottom-up (Fp2 → Fp6 → Fp12 → Miller → FinalExp → full verifier),
  a break surfaces in the smallest failing layer instead of only at the ~20 KB / ~M-opcode end product.
- **Fast, isolated tests** — check an Fp2 multiply without running the whole pairing.
- **Per-layer size / op-cost** — each compiles on its own, so a layer's cost is measurable in isolation.

The libraries are what make this cheap: every harness *and* the full verifier share one implementation
from `lib/`, so a layer is written (or fixed) once and all of them pick it up. Files in `lib/` contain
only top-level functions (no `contract`, never deployed); the parent-directory files use `contract`.

## The two arithmetic schemes

The hand-written sources use two different field-arithmetic conventions, so there are two towers:

- **Reduced** (`lib/*.cash`): `addFp`/`subFp` reduce mod p; standard signatures. Used by almost
  everything.
- **Lazy** (`lib/lazy/Bn254Lazy.cash`): `addFp(x,y)=x+y` and `subFp(x,y,k)=x-y+k*p` do **not** reduce
  (only `mulFp` does); a per-call-site `k` bias is threaded through the subtractive ops. Different
  arities, so it cannot share the reduced tower. Used only by the two performance-critical loops
  (`miller`, `finalexp`).

The two towers deliberately reuse the same function *names* (`addFp`, `fp2Mul`, …). That's safe because
a contract imports exactly one tower, so the names never collide.

## Reduced tower — dependency graph

```
Fp.cash            base field Fp (the prime appears as a literal at each use site)
 └─ Fp2.cash       Fp2 = Fp[u]/(u^2+1)        imports Fp
     └─ Fp6.cash   Fp6 = Fp2[v]/(v^3-xi)      imports Fp2   (+ fp6Mul01 for mul034)
         └─ Fp12.cash   Fp12 = Fp6[w]/(w^2-v) imports Fp6   (+ mul034, frobenius, inverse)
             ├─ Miller.cash    G2 point/line ops, line, psi, millerSingle, g2 subgroup check
             └─ FinalExp.cash  cyclotomic squaring/exp, final exponentiation
G1.cash            G1 (Fp) Jacobian group law + scalar mult (vk_x)   imports Fp
```

`import` is transitive and the diamond (e.g. `Fp` reached via several paths) is de-duplicated by the
compiler. **Dead-code elimination** then drops every imported function a given contract never calls,
so importing a big tower costs only the bytecode actually used; the compiler also **inlines** any
function where splicing the body at its call sites is cheaper by exact byte accounting than
OP_DEFINE/OP_INVOKE (single-use functions always inline).

## What each consumer imports

| Contract (`../*.cash`) | Imports | What it exercises |
|---|---|---|
| `fp2` | `Fp2` | Fp2 mul/sqr/inv/mulXi/conj |
| `fp6` | `Fp6` | Fp6 mul/sqr/mulByV |
| `fp12`, `fp12_inv`, `fp12_frob` | `Fp12` | Fp12 mul/sqr/conj, inverse, Frobenius |
| `mul034` | `Fp12` | sparse line multiply |
| `g2lines` | `Miller` | pointDouble / pointAdd |
| `miller4` | `Miller` | 4-pair Miller product |
| `verify` | `Miller`, `FinalExp` | 4-pair pairing == 1 |
| `groth16` | `Miller`, `FinalExp`, `G1` | **full Groth16 verifier** |
| `vkx` | `Fp` | G1 arithmetic (inlined in spend) |
| `miller`, `finalexp` | `lazy/Bn254Lazy` | lazy-scheme Miller loop / final exponentiation |

## Adding / verifying a consumer

A consumer is just: `pragma`, the `import`s it needs, and a `contract` with only its `spend()`:

```cash
pragma cashscript ^0.14.0;
import "./lib/Fp12.cash";
contract Foo() { function spend(...) { ... fp12Mul(...) ... } }
```

Grade any contract against its reference vectors with its harness:

```sh
node ../X.mjs          # e.g. node ../groth16.mjs   -> prints PASS/FAIL
```

(`vkx` is graded by `build_vectors_vkx.mjs` with constructor binding; set `OUT=/tmp/…` so it doesn't
overwrite the verifier repo's vectors.)

Compile to bytecode/size with the fork's CLI:

```sh
node <cashscript>/packages/cashc/dist/cashc-cli.js ../groth16.cash -h   # hex
node <cashscript>/packages/cashc/dist/cashc-cli.js ../groth16.cash -s   # bytesize
```

## Why this is a win

Every original `*.cash` harness re-declared the entire field tower inline. These libraries hold one
canonical copy; the contracts shrink to their `spend()`. Where the originals were byte-for-byte
consistent, the library build is **byte-identical** (`fp2`, `fp6`, `fp12`, `mul034`, `vkx`); where they
had value-equal micro-variants, it consolidates them to one implementation (verified by the graders).
